Big Mart Sales Prediction - Regression Project
This project aims to predict product sales for Big Mart, a retail giant operating across various cities. We leverage machine learning techniques to build accurate regression models, enabling Big Mart to:

Optimize inventory management: By understanding sales trends and forecasts, Big Mart can maintain optimal stock levels, reducing storage costs and preventing stockouts.
Enhance pricing strategies: Sales predictions can inform pricing decisions, allowing Big Mart to adjust prices based on demand and maximize profits.
Improve store performance: Identifying factors influencing sales across different stores can help Big Mart optimize store operations and tailor marketing strategies for each location.
